# Image Caption Generation using Transformers and Streamlit

Generate descriptive captions for images using the power of Transformers and its components: VisionEncoderDecoderModel, ViTFeatureExtractor, AutoTokenizer, and deploy the app on Streamlit Cloud.

## Introduction

Image captioning is the fascinating task of generating textual descriptions for images, enabling machines to understand and communicate the content of visual data. This project leverages the capabilities of the VisionEncoderDecoderModel, ViTFeatureExtractor, and AutoTokenizer from the Transformers library to automatically generate captions for images. The app is deployed on Streamlit Cloud for easy access and sharing.

## Demo

Check out the live demo of the deployed app: [Image Captioning App](https://share.streamlit.io/your-username/your-app-repo/main/image_caption_app.py)

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Python 3.6 or higher installed.
- Streamlit and Transformers libraries. Install them using the command:
  ```bash
  pip install streamlit transformers
  ```
- Images you wish to caption in formats like jpg, jpeg, or png.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-app-repo.git
   cd your-app-repo
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app locally:
   ```bash
   streamlit run image_caption_app.py
   ```

4. To deploy on Streamlit Cloud, follow these steps:

   - Create a free account on [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud).
   - Push your app repository to GitHub.
   - Connect your GitHub repository to Streamlit Cloud.
   - Configure environment variables, if needed.
   - Deploy the app on Streamlit Cloud.

5. Access the deployed app by clicking on the Streamlit Cloud link in the "Demo" section above.
